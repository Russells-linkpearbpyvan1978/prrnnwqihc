Just walked out of the theater from seeing The Amateur. I’m telling you, my brain feels like that weird moment when you open a jar of pickles and the lid pops off with that awkward, unexpected vacuum sound. You ever felt simultaneously impressed and mildly annoyed? Like the   was a chaotic mix of thunderstorm and drizzle, or like an existential crisis wrapped in a really itchy wool sweater, but somehow, you keep 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, tugging at the yarn for reasons unknown.

First off, the plot – it’s both utterly predictable and shockingly twisty, in that “I kind of knew but also was never sure” way. It’s about spies, right? But not cool, gadget-y spies like Bond, more like the clumsy neighbor who ends up spying because they mistakenly 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed a classified document while trying to 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 a cat video. The main guy, bless him, looked like he just came out of an all-night Dungeons & Dragons bender and somehow fumbled his way into spy work. Maybe I’m tired or just done with everything ever, but his face had that I-just-woke-up confusion plastered all over it. Like he was perpetually five seconds away from realizing he left the oven on.

> Wait, let’s not forget the soundtrack. It’s like an eager puppy chasing its tail. Swirling violins at a chase scene, boom. Sudden piano when there's a heartbreaking revelation, boom. You can practically see the music notes jumping off the screen and doing a jig in front of you.

But really, some of the dialogues – poetic and dense one moment, and the next, as fragmented as my attention span after a coffee-fueled all-nighter. One of the lines actually had me whispering “what the heck” halfway through my popcorn. Something about life being a series of amateur attempts at greatness. Made me feel both profound and supremely befuddled, haha. You think you’re mostly adult-ish, and then a   makes you question if you're just an amateur at everything. Dammit,  .

So, in conclusion, should you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it for a rainy day? Maybe! It’s one of those where you emerge feeling a little like your pockets are full of marbles and the world is a slightly bigger question mark. Or maybe just an ellipsis. A long, loopy ellipsis that doesn’t know when to stop, kinda like me just now.
